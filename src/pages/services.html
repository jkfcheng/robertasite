		<h2>Services</h2>
    <p class="blurb no-bottom">I draw from a range of approaches in my work - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family Systems, and Psychodynamic. I believe that there is no one-size-fits all and tailor to the needs and personalities of my clients for the best collaborative work. I also use mindfulness techniques in the sessions, and pay attention to how culture and spirituality impact oneâ€™s well being and healing process. </p>
		<p class="blurb no-bottom">I have experience working with children, teens and families in individual and family sessions. I love working with teens and am especially passionate about seeing families connected together and addressing issues that arise from cross-cultural generations. I am particularly experienced in working with the following areas:</p>
