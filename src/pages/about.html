		<h2>About</h2>
		<p class="blurb no-bottom">I believe that therapy offers a sacred space for one to be heard and wholly accepted. I view my role as empowering you to make changes in your life and honoring the path of your healing.</p>
    <p class="blurb no-bottom">My style of therapy is to fully listen and to provide a reflection of what I observe and gently challenge patterns of behaviors that keep you from living a life that is fulfilling. I meet you where you are at and give you ownership to set the pace of your work. </p>

		<p class="blurb">I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of California Davis and a Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy from Western Seminary.  In the last four years, I have had the privilege to work alongside children, teens, and families in Fremont, Santa Clara County, and in Campbell - providing counseling in various settings such as outpatient clinic, elementary and high schools. </p>
