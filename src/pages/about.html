		<h2>About</h2>
		<p class="blurb no-bottom">I believe that therapy offers a sacred space for one to be heard and wholly accepted. I view my role as empowering you to make changes in your life and honoring the path of your healing. Throughout the course of this life, you may find yourself experiencing pain, loss, conflict, and dissatisfaction - whether this is in your relationships, work or school life. I believe that you do not have to be defined by your past or current experiences, but rather who you set out to be. Therapy is difficult and courageous work, but I have witnessed many great changes and healing through it.</p>
		<p class="blurb no-bottom">My style of therapy is to fully listen and to provide a reflection of what I observe, and gently challenge patterns of behaviors that keep you from living a life that is fulfilling. I meet you where you are at and give you ownership to set the pace of your work.</p>

		<p class="blurb">I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of California Davis and a Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy from Western Seminary. In the last four years, I have had the privilege to work alongside children, teens, and families in Fremont, Santa Clara County, and in Campbell - providing counseling in various settings such as outpatient clinic, elementary and high schools. Working with clients from diverse backgrounds has shaped me to provide therapy that is culturally sensitive, collaborative, and empathetic. I am a Bay Area native and growing up with Chinese immigrant parents helped me understand the complicated navigation of cross-cultural generations.</p>
