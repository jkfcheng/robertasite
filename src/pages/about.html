		<h2>About</h2>
		<p class="blurb no-bottom">I believe that therapy offers a sacred space for one to be heard and wholly accepted. I view my role as empowering you to make changes in your life and honoring the path of your healing. Throughout the course of this life, you may find yourself experiencing pain, loss, conflict, and dissatisfaction - whether this is in your relationships, work or school life. I believe that you do not have to be defined by your past or current experiences, but rather who you set out to be. Therapy is difficult and courageous work, but I have witnessed many great changes and healing through it.</p>
		<p class="blurb no-bottom">My style of therapy is to fully listen, provide a reflection, and gently challenge patterns of behaviors that keep you from living a life that is fulfilling. I meet you where you are at and give you ownership to set the pace of your work.</p>

		<p class="blurb">I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Davis and a Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy from Western Seminary. In the last four years, I have had the privilege to work alongside children, teens, and families in Fremont, San Jose, and Campbell - providing support in various settings such as outpatient clinics, elementary and high schools. Working with clients from diverse backgrounds have shaped me to provide therapy that is culturally sensitive, collaborative, and empathetic. Also, as a daughter of Chinese immigrant parents in the Bay Area, Iâ€™ve had to navigate complicated and delicate cross-cultural dynamics across generations. I hope to support others whose experiences are similar to mine.</p>
