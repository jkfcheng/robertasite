        <p class="blurb no-bottom">Hello and welcome. My name is Roberta Cheng and I am a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. In the last couple of years, I have been supporting children, teens and families throughout the Bay Area.</p>
        <p class="blurb"> Throughout the course of this life, you may find yourself experiencing pain, loss, conflict, and dissatisfaction - whether this is in your relationships, work or school life. I believe that you do not have to be defined by your past or current experiences, but rather who you set out to be. Therapy is difficult and courageous work, but I have witnessed many great changes and healing through it.</p>
